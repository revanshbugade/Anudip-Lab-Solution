" 1. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list."

# Define a list of numbers
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Initialize the sum to 0
total_sum = 0

# Iterate through each item in the list and add it to the total_sum
for number in a:
    total_sum += number

# Print the result
print("The sum of all items in the list is:", total_sum)
